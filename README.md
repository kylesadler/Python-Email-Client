# AT-Email-Alerts

This repository contains code for automatically sending emails about newly scraped farms. Each person on the alert list is subscribed to a list of sites. When new properties are listed on these sites, the person is notified.

To run, the environment variables `ALERT_USERNAME` and `ALERT_PASSWORD` need to be set. The alert email address is `acretrader.alerts@gmail.com`.
